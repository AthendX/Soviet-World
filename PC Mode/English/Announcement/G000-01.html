        Hey, nice to meet you here! Although we have never met, I think from this moment on, we are comrades. I'm not a
        professional
        team that maintains and operates a website, and I don't even know if I can have a team -- when I first started
        building
        the code for this website, I was still a middle school student in the first grade of junior high school. Like
        you, I'm
        just an ordinary person who simply yearns for the beam of "human light". Although he has fallen, I believe that
        the
        belief in red will live on in our hearts forever!

    <div style="font-size: 20px">

        If you have anything you want to share with comrades or have better suggestions for the website, please contact
        me via
        email "AthendX@yandex.ru", I will reply as soon as possible and present your contribution on our website (If
        your
        submission is related to the subject of this site and complies with relevant laws and regulations)

        About this website, what I want to say is that this is not "my" website, but our website. If you are willing to
        join the
        construction and maintenance of this website, comrade, I will always express my sincere welcome to you! I still
        have a
        lot of ideas about this website, such as search function, account coding function, forum function, etc., but I
        can't put
        them into practice due to the limited level, which is a big failure.In addition, as a student from China, my
        English and
        Russian expressions may not be particularly standard. I look forward to having someone to help me!

        I think that there is no harm in opening the source code of this website. If you think it is necessary, you can
        easily
        get all the source code of this website
